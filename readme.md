!This asset pack is not finished yet!

This is an asset replacement meant for https://github.com/liberated-cortex/CCOSS.

The goal is to make the game playable with this replacement, it's not meant as a full replacement for Cortex Command.

It's also diserable to reach a stage, where standalone mods can build upon this.
