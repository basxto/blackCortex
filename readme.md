!This asset pack is not finished yet!

This is an asset replacement meant for https://github.com/liberated-cortex/CCOSS.

The goal is to make the game playable with this replacement, it's not meant as a full replacement for Cortex Command.

It's also diserable to reach a stage, where standalone mods can build upon this.

All code is licensed under MIT license.

See [attribution.md](./attribution.md) for graphics attributions.

Some images have to be converted from PNG to BMP.
This can be done with:
```
$ make
```


Currently you need to copy a few files from your original copy of Cortex Command:
* Base.rte/GUIs/
